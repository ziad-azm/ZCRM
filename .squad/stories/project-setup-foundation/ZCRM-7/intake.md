## Source — work item (from tracker)

**Title:** SETUP-6 — CORS & Frontend API Client  
**Type:** Story  
**Status:** To Do  
**Assignee:** Ziad Hosny

### Description

As a developer, I want to configure CORS and the frontend API client, so that the Angular app and Golang backend can communicate securely.

Description: Wire the two apps together. The backend is configured to accept requests from the Angular origin, and the frontend gets an HTTP interceptor that will centralize shared request behavior (base headers now, the auth token later). The story ends with a verified end-to-end request.

Tasks:

	Task: Add configurable CORS middleware on the backend

	Task: Create the Angular HTTP interceptor

	Task: Verify an end-to-end call from the frontend to GET /health

# Story intake

Fill this template for each story you want planned. Keep it copy-paste-friendly: the planner reads **this file and the files in `attachments/`**, nothing else.

- Folder: `.squad/stories/project-setup-foundation/ZCRM-7/intake.md`
- Binaries (screenshots, PDFs, exports): put them in `attachments/` next to this file and list them below.
- Do **not** rely on external links (tracker URLs, wiki, chat) — the planner cannot open them. Paste the content you want considered.

This is **not** an implementation prompt. It is the input to the plan-generation meta-prompt bundled with squad-kit (`generate-plan.md` in the installed package).
